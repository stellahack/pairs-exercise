= Quick start: manage an API and set up a proxy for

//Exercise for editor candidate

In the following exercise, we will create an API that can be managed via API Manager and set up a proxy for the API that runs in CloudHub. Follow these steps:

== Creating an API asset in AnyPoint Exchange

Follow these steps to create a new asset:
//if there is a standard intro for procedures, use it here.

. <<create_an_api, Create an API in Exchange>>
// Are we creating an API in the current procedure, or linking to a different topic? 
//OK to shorten "Anypoint Exchange" to "Exchange"? 
. <<import-api-to-API-Manager, Import Your API to API Manager.>>
. <<<<configure_and_deploy_to_cloudhub, Configure an API proxy and deploy it to CloudHub.>>
// Consider removing steps 1-3 from the procedure and perhaps presenting in the overview sentence preceding the "Creating an API" heading.. Ex: "To create an API proxy, you will create the API in Exchange, add the API to API Manager," etc.
. Go to this URL: https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange
//Make the above step 1, because that's the first actual user action.
//Does the user need to log in or authenticate when they log in, before the next step?

. Click the `New Asset` button.
. In the `Publish New Asset` view, choose the asset type and and asset name. 
// Are we choosing an asset name from an existing list, or do we need to create a new asset with a new name?
If you choose the asset type  RAML, OAS or WSDL, specify the associated file.
//What type of file (extension)? Will the user already know what file is needed, and will it already be installed?
//Is there a specific directory or path for the associated file?
//Perhaps link to a list of asset types?

. Click the `Publish' button.

Now we have successfully created an API asset in the Exchange.
//Perhaps something like "You see the new asset in the Exchange window"--i.e. tell the user what they'll see when it is sucessful.

== Importing the asset into API Manager

Follow these steps to import your new asset API into API Manager:

. In the API Administration Dashboard, click Manage API > Manage API from Exchange
//Is Manage API a tab, a drop-down menu, or ? Can we guide the user more explicitly?

. In the next screen,  complete the following fields:
//Does the next screen have a name, such as "Import New Asset"? Is it a dialog box?
//Set the following instructions as sub-steps to step 2. Alternatively, give each its own numbered step at the same level.
*API Name*: Type the first characters of the API name that you created in Exchange.
//Check style guide--use "Enter" instead of "Type"?
**Managing Type*: For this example, choose `Endpoint with Proxy`. 
*Asset Type*: Choose HTTP.
 *Mule version* If you are managing an API for Mule 4 and above, put an `x` in this checkbox.
 //Query: verion number.
*Implementation URI*: Enter the URL for which the API implementation resides. For this example, we are using http://my-implementation.company.com

If you are managing an API for Mule 4 or above, please make sure you select the checkbox. In this example, we are creating the API for Mule 4.

If you need further configuration, you may want to click in advanced options, and fill in the options available as displayed.

Click on `Save`.

After that, the API settings view is shown with the current information of the recently imported API.
So far, we have created an instance of an API Specification that can now be managed.

== Conf
igure a Proxy to Cloudhub

Deploying an API Proxy to CloudHub lets you protect your API implementation without having to worry about the infrastructure details, and quickly. We do all the hard work for you, so now lets do this final step:

. In the API Settings view, make sure your `Proxy deployment target` configuration is set to `CloudHub`
. Scroll down until you hit `Deployment Configuration`.
. In `Runtime Version`, select the runtime version you need, and set a name for your application.
. Finally, click on `deploy`.
Once you see the following pop-up, then your API proxy is successfully running in a CloudHub instance.
